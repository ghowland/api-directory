# api-directory
Python library to configure how to access an API, like if it was a file system directory structure

This is a planned project.

This project will be a base library for 2 other projects:

- Wrapping access into an API through the ShellInABox javascript code, so that one can act like they are in a CLI, while actually just making web calls in a browser page, with full VT100 control.

- Using this for FUSE libraries, so that they can connect to APIs when accessing directory structures, primarily for providing a hierarchical organization of reports (as files), and also allowing functions to be run by creating executable scripts which call the API, and return the result.
